# NetZero: Comprehensive Counterparty Risk Analysis Platform

## Inspiration

The need for a transparent and reliable solution to analyze counterparty risk inspired us to create **NetZero**. With businesses relying on incomplete or unverified data, we aimed to develop a platform that integrates diverse data sources to provide actionable insights and ensure trustworthy decision-making.

## What it does

NetZero aggregates and analyzes data from multiple sources, including:
- **Lawsuits**
- **Social Media Sentiment**
- **Credit History**

The platform evaluates counterparty risk comprehensively by leveraging advanced AI models to:
- Summarize information
- Generate semantic scores
- Present results with clear citations for transparency and reliability

## How we built it

1. **Data Collection**
   - Leveraged APIs, web scraping, and historical datasets for lawsuits, social media sentiment, and credit history.
2. **AI Models**
   - Used summarization models to process and summarize the data.
3. **Backend**
   - Developed a robust backend using FastAPI for seamless data integration and API handling.
4. **Visualization**
   - Designed an intuitive user interface to ensure usability and clarity.

## Challenges we ran into

- **Real-time Credit Data**
  - Obtaining real-time credit data was challenging due to API limitations and restricted access. This was mitigated by using historical datasets to ensure consistency and relevance.
- **Unstructured Data**
  - Preprocessing and validating unstructured data from diverse sources to maintain data quality required significant effort.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of

- Built an **end-to-end solution** integrating diverse datasets to provide a unified view of counterparty risk.
- Delivered transparent analyses, precise scores, and well-cited results to ensure user trust.
- Overcame data access challenges and ensured seamless integration of AI models.

## What we learned

- Gained insights into multi-source data aggregation, including legal and credit data.
- Enhanced understanding of transparency and reliability in risk analysis.
- Learned to handle unstructured data and develop scalable AI-powered solutions.

## What’s next for NetZero

- **Expansion of Data Sources**
  - Integrate additional data sources like Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics to broaden risk analysis.
- **AI Model Enhancement**
  - Improve sentiment analysis and enable real-time scoring.
- **Collaboration with Paid Services**
  - Partner with reputable paid services to provide comprehensive datasets, eliminating the need for users to rely on multiple platforms.
